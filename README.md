# OthelloAI
Implementation of Othello AI utilizing given template. Implemented utilizing tree data structure and DFS traversal. 

All logic and functions are found within "core" directory. Some function calls such as isWhiteTurn() are simple methods called on the game board stored in the variable "state" that we're given in the template but are self explanatory. Hope you enjoy!
